# AI-Assisted Job Scheduling in Operating Systems

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance job scheduling in operating systems using machine learning. The primary goal is to simulate scheduling algorithms and compare traditional methods with machine learning-based predictions.

### Objectives:
1. **Train a machine learning model** to predict job runtimes based on synthetic features.
2. Implement traditional OS scheduling algorithms: **First-Come First-Served (FCFS)** and **Round-Robin (RR)**.
3. Implement a **Predicted-Shortest-Job-Time (Predicted-SJF)** scheduler enhanced with machine learning predictions.
4. Evaluate and compare the performance of different algorithms based on key metrics.

## File Structure

### 1. **baseline.py**
   - Implements baseline scheduling algorithms:
     - **First-Come First-Served (FCFS)**
     - **Round-Robin (RR)**

### 2. **Course Project.pdf**
   - Project report containing detailed descriptions of the project objectives, methods, and results.

### 3. **data_loader.py**
   - Loads the job data from CSV files and processes them into job objects.

### 4. **grid_search.log**
   - Log file for hyperparameter tuning results during the training of machine learning models.

### 5. **predictor.py**
   - Contains the machine learning model used to predict job runtimes, including training and prediction functions.

### 6. **scheduler_psfj_true.py**
   - Implements the **Predicted-SJF** scheduler **without AI**, used as a baseline for comparison.

### 7. **random_forest_model.pkl**
   - The trained Random Forest model used to predict job runtimes.

### 8. **scaler.pkl**
   - A saved scaler object used for feature standardization during model prediction.

### 9. **scheduler_psfj.py**
   - Implements the **Predicted-SJF** scheduler **with AI**. This scheduler selects jobs based on predicted runtimes generated by the machine learning model.

### 10. **testing_jobs.csv**
   - CSV file containing test data used to evaluate the performance of the scheduling algorithms.

### 11. **training_jobs.csv**
   - CSV file containing training data used to train the machine learning model.

### 12. **xgboost_model.pkl**
   - The trained XGBoost model used to predict job runtimes.

## Key Features and Functionality

### 1. **Loading and Sorting Jobs**
   - Jobs are loaded from the provided CSV files and stored as job objects.
   - Jobs are sorted by **arrive_time** to simulate the order in which they arrive in the system.

### 2. **Implementing FCFS and RR**
   - **FCFS**: Jobs are executed in the order of their arrival time.
   - **RR**: Implements the Round-Robin scheduling algorithm with a user-defined time quantum.

### 3. **Building the Predictor**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., **Random Forest** or **XGBoost**) is trained to predict job runtimes based on features like **model_size**, **dataset_size**, and **epochs**.
   - **predict_runtime(job)** function provides predictions for job runtimes.

### 4. **Predicted-SJF Scheduler (Non-preemptive)**
   - The scheduler selects jobs based on the shortest predicted runtime. Once a job starts, it runs until completion without preemption.

### 5. **Predicted-Shortest-Remaining-Time-First Scheduler (Preemptive)**
   - An additional feature for **group projects**. This scheduler selects the job with the shortest predicted remaining runtime among all jobs that have arrived. If a new job arrives with a shorter predicted remaining time, the scheduler preempts the currently running job.
